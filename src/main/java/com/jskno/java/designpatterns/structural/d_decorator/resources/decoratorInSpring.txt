Decorator design pattern in the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework uses the Decorator design pattern to build important functionalities such as transactions,
cache synchronization, and security-related tasks.
Let's look at some functionalities where Spring implements this pattern transparently:

    * Weaving the advice into the Spring application. It uses the Decorator pattern via the CGLib proxy.
    It works by generating a subclass of the target class at runtime.
    * BeanDefinitionDecorator : It is used to decorate the bean definition via applied custom attributes.
    * WebSocketHandlerDecorator: It is used to decorate a WebSocketHandler with additional behaviors.
