
Proxy pattern in the Spring Framework

Spring Framework uses the Proxy design pattern in the Spring AOP module transparently.
In Spring AOP, you create proxies of the object to apply cross cutting concern across the point cut
in the Spring application.
In the Spring, other modules also implement the Proxy pattern, such as RMI, Spring's HTTP Invoker,
Hessian, and Burlap.
