
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
 - GOF Design Patterns

The Facade design pattern is nothing but an interface of interfaces to simplify interactions between
the client code and subsystem classes.
This design comes under the GOF structural design pattern.

Benefits of Facade Pattern:

    * This pattern reduces the complexities for clients to interact with subsystems
    * This pattern consolidates all the business services as single interfaces to make them more
    understandable
    * This pattern reduces dependencies of client code on the inner workings of a system
