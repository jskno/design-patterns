Pattern Variants

    Some variations on the base Composite pattern include:

    The root node – To improve manageability in systems, some Composite implementers define a distinct object
    that acts as the base for the entire Composite object hierarchy. If the root object is represented as a separate class,
    it can be implemented as a Singleton, or the access to the root node can be granted through a Singleton, without
    the class itself being a Singleton.

    Rule-based branching – For more complex Composite structures, typically those with multiple types of nodes
    and branches, you might need to enforce rules about how and when certain kinds of nodes can be joined to certain
    branch types.
