Observer pattern in the Spring Framework

In the Spring Framework, the Observer design pattern is used to implement event handling function of
ApplicationContext. Spring provides us the ApplicationEvent class and ApplicationListener interface to enable
event handling in Spring ApplicationContext. Any bean in your Spring application implements the
ApplicationListener interface, it will receive an ApplicationEvent every time the ApplicationEvent
is published by an event publisher.
Here, the event publisher is the subject and the bean that implements ApplicationListener is the observer.
