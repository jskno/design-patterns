
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without Exposing its underlying
representation.
-GOF Design Pattern

This pattern allows you to access the items from the collection object in sequence without information its internal
representation.

These are following benefits of the Iterator pattern:
    *   Easily access the items of the collection.
    *   You can use multiple to access the item from the collection because it support lot of variations in
    the traversal.
    *   It provides a uniform interface for traversing different structures in a collection.
